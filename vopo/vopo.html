            <div class="paragraphText">
            <p>This section provides an overview of the People's Polices's history, including its role and significance
                in the former German Democratic Republic.</p>


            <p>The People's Police was the national police force of the German Democratic Republic. <br><br> Originally
                founded in 1945 it would officially become the People's Police in 1949. <br><br> It is not to be
                confused with the Kasernierte Volkspolizei which was the precursor to the Nationale Volksarmee.</p>

            <h2>Uniforms</h2>
            <h4>Uniforms differed depending on the branch the officer was in as well as their rank.</h4>
        
            <br>

            <h3>Protection Police - Schutzpolizei (included waterway police and transport police although transport had
                a different uniform)</h3>

                <div class="paragraphText">
            <p>The standard Volkspolizei (VoPo) uniform consisted of a green jacket, trousers, tie, hat and sometimes a leather
                belt (although it was uncommon outside of parades). <br><br> Equipment included a pistol holster, cuffs, whistle (green lanyard in jacket pocket),
                telescopic baton (hidden from view
                in jacket pocket) and map case. <br><br> From 1975 officers could be seen carrying a UFT 721 radio
                attached to a UBT 70 control panel - it would usually be worn on the right side of the officer. </p>

            <h3>Traffic Police - Verkehrspolizei</h3>

            <div class="paragraphText">
            <p>Here we can see that traffic police wore a white hat/shirt and carried a traffic baton. <br><br>This
                baton was battery operated (to allow for illumination in darkness) and made of plastic.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Transport Police - Transportpolizei</h3>

            <br>

            <div class="paragraphText">
            <p>Here we can see that transport police wore a blue hat/shirt/patch. <br><br>Real life photos of the
                transport police are rare but this stamp shows what they would have looked like. <br><br> The transport police were responsible for monitoring all major train stations and also checked passengers on domestic trains near the border with the Federal Republic of Germany. <br><br>They were also tasked with accompanying the transit trains that ran between West Germany and West Berlin. </p>

            <h3>Summer - Sommer</h3>
            <div class="paragraphText">
            <p>In summer officers were permitted to ditch the jacket and only wear their shirt. <br><br>
                (Potentially just higher ranks however as most images of what seems summer shows full uniform in use)
